# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Machine-Learning
This project was done using various data mining and machine learning techniques.
Main purpose of this project is to provide good quality wine to customers.
Various components of wine is used to predict the quality of wine.
Data mining techniques were used to check whether the data provided was accurate.
Most of the data was accurate except for few which was handled using box-plot.
Box-plot is a visualization technique, used to show if the data is deviated from other data points.
These type of data are called outliers.
Outliers were handled using Mean/Median imputation.
Wine quality prediction means good or bad, so this means its a classification problem.
Machine learning Classification algorithms were used to make the prediction.
Classification algorithm like Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector machine were used.
The accuracy of the model was determined using confusion matrix.
The above mentioned models provided good results, thus making the predictions more accurate.
